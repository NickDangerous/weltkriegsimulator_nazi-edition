        This is not a game. This is full-on onslaught on several levels!
        Namely, the <i>upper</i> and the <i>lower</i> level. Action happens on different
        vertical planes. As such, apart from steering your ship and shooting at your enemies, you
        will also need to keep an eye on whether you need to dive or rise during battle. The background
        colour changes to indicate on which plane you are currently flying.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not a game. You don't get extra lives. When you crash into a rigid body at high velocity,
        you die. Your ship can take a few bullets though. Keep an eye on your energy level (top right) and
        be on the look out for health power ups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Power ups are spread over both the higher and lower plane and also come in the form of bonus
        points and weapon upgrades. Weapon upgrades provide you with immense firing capability (for
        instance the killer beam of the laser or the 360 degree onslaught of the bullet spray), but
        weapons only last for a fixed period of time.

        <strong>Keyboard controls:</strong> use either WASD or arrow keys to steer, spacebar to shoot and Z
        to dive/rise into a different plane.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Touchscreen controls:</strong> steer by using the D-Pad on the lower left of the screen, hit the
        A button to shoot and the B button to dive/rise.
